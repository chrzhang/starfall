##[Play](http://chrzhang.github.io/starfall/)

A clone of the game Space Shooters in Unity3d with the official tutorials and a little customization.
Currently still in development.

##Customization Ideas
1. Manually activate shields (which will be depleted from a regenerating source).
2. Blink (flash out of material existence to dodge incoming collisions).
3. Activate additional engines (increase speed temporarily).
