========

##[Play](http://chrzhang.github.io/starfall/)

A clone of the game Space Shooters in Unity3d with the official tutorials and a little customization.
Currently still in development.

##Customization Ideas
IMPLEMENTED
1. Randomized sscale, tumble (angular velocity), and speed.
2. Asteroids will not "collide" with asteroids, causing confusing FX effects.

FUTURE
1. Manually activate shields (which will be depleted from a regenerating source).
2. Blink (flash out of material existence to dodge incoming collisions).
3. Activate additional engines (increase speed temporarily).
